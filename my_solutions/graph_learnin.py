# EDGE RELAXATION #
###################
#real code but not used:
def Relax(u, v, weight, parent, dist):
    if dist[v] > dist[u] + weight(u, v):
        dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v)
        parent[v] = u
# we have some distance to v (perhaps initialized to INF) then we check if the current distance to V is greater than
 # distance to U + weight(u,v).  If so, dist(v) is updated to distance going through u-v edge.  AND we update parent of
 # V to be U (since that's the best way to get there.

 #PSEUDO CODE (find the path to node from all adjacent nodes):
 #1. Select edge (u, v) from the graph.
 #2.  Relax edge (u, v).
 #3. repeat 1 and 2, selecting edges in some order, until no edges can be relaxed (d[v] â‰¤ d[a] + weight(a, v) for all edges (a, v))
 # Pick all edges leading to this point and find the shortest one.  Now on to how we pick these edges
